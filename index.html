            <h2 class="headers">1. Guthrie Govan</h2>
            <p>Govan began playing guitar aged three, encouraged by his father, but initially learning mainly by ear. His father taught him six chords, and introduced him to his record collection. Govan began listening to 1950s rock 'n' roll artists such as Jerry Lee Lewis and Little Richard; he then moved on to later eras, listening to such bands as The Beatles, Cream and Jimi Hendrix, Frank Zappa, and AC/DC, among others. He worked out chords and solos from listening to the records. Half-Scottish, Govan was also heavily influenced by Zal Cleminson, a Scottish guitarist best known for his work with the Alex Harvey Band.[1] At the age of nine, Govan and his brother Seth played guitar on a Thames Television programme called Ace Reports. At secondary school he was exposed, via older classmates, to "shred" guitarists of the time.[2] His first electric guitar was a Gibson SG, which he keeps at home.</p>
